<H2>The Bermuda Triangle, also known as the Devil's Triangle or Hurricane Alley, is a loosely defined region in the western part of the North Atlantic Ocean where a number of aircraft and ships are said to have disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Most reputable sources dismiss the idea that there is any mystery.
The vicinity of the Bermuda Triangle is amongst the most heavily traveled shipping lanes in the world, with ships frequently crossing through it for ports in the Americas, Europe and the Caribbean islands.<BR> Cruise ships and pleasure craft regularly sail through the region, and commercial and private aircraft routinely fly over it.
<BR>Popular culture has attributed various disappearances to the paranormal or activity by extraterrestrial beings. Documented evidence indicates that a significant percentage of the incidents were spurious, inaccurately reported, or embellished by later authors.

<H2><b><i><u>DISCOVERY OF BERMUDA TRINGLE</u></b></i>
<BR>
<BR>
</H2><H3>The earliest suggestion of unusual disappearances in the Bermuda area appeared in a September 17, 1950, article published in The Miami Herald (Associated Press by Edward Van Winkle Jones Two years later, Fate magazine published "Sea Mystery at Our Back Door",a short article by George Sand covering the loss of several planes and ships, including the loss of Flight 19, a group of five US Navy Grumman TBM Avenger torpedo bombers on a training mission.
<BR>Sand's article was the first to lay out the now-familiar triangular area where the losses took place, as well as the first to suggest a supernatural element to the Flight 19 incident.
Flight 19 alone would be covered again in the April 1962 issue of American Legion magazine.<BR>
In it, author Allan W. Eckert wrote that the flight leader had been heard saying, "We are entering white water, nothing seems right.
We don't know where we are, the water is green, no white."<BR> He also wrote that officials at the Navy board of inquiry stated that the planes "flew off to Mars."
In February 1964, Vincent Gaddis wrote an article called "The Deadly Bermuda Triangle" in the pulp magazine Argosy saying Flight 19 and other disappearances were part of a pattern of strange events in the region.
The next year, Gaddis expanded this article into a book, Invisible Horizons.<BR>
Other writers elaborated on Gaddis' ideas: John Wallace Spencer (Limbo of the Lost, 1969, repr. 1973); Charles Berlitz (The Bermuda Triangle, 1974); Richard Winer (The Devil's Triangle, 1974), and many others, all keeping to some of the same supernatural elements outlined by Eckert.

<H2>The Gaddis Argosy article delineated the boundaries of the triangle,  giving its vertices as Miami; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Bermuda.<BR>
Subsequent writers did not necessarily follow this definition.<BR> Some writers gave different boundaries and vertices to the triangle, with the total area varying from 1,300,000 to 3,900,000 km2 (500,000 to 1,510,000 sq mi). "Indeed, some writers even stretch it as far as the Irish coast." Consequently, the determination of which accidents occurred inside the triangle depends on which writer reported them.

<H2>Mystery around the notorious Bermuda Triangle continues to intrigue scientists as well as regular people. There are numerous theories and possibilities surrounding it, but no concrete conclusions that unravel the secret behind the weird disappearances of flights and ships passing the Triangle’s territory.<BR> If you are among those who have just faintly heard of it, read on as we dig deeper into the its strangest Bermuda triangle stories and occurrences.
The term Bermuda Triangle was coined by Vincent H Gaddis in 1964.<BR>He wrote an article on the strange pattern of disappearances in the Triangle. Once an unnamed area in North Atlantic Ocean, Bermuda Triangle and its stories became a rage in 1970s. Many pilots and sea-navigators came forward to share the tales of mishappenings and accounts of loss. Many such Bermuda Triangle stories were found to be fake, created in order to gain publicity, while others were backed with solid proofs.
<BR><BR><BR>In fact, its first written account is in the journal of the famous sea-explorer, Christopher Columbus in the 15th century.<BR>He mentioned in his journal that his compass went berserk once they touched an unseen boundary between Florida and Puerto Rico.<BR><BR> Since then, there have been many stories doing the rounds, and to cut it all short, here’s all you need to know to raise and settle the curiosity about the infamous Triangle.
</H2></font>
<font color="blue"><I><H1>Here are some theories related to Bermuda triangle</H1></I></font>
<font color="Red"><H1><b>Theory #1 – Devil’s Triangle</b></H1><BR></font>
<H2><BR>This is the most used pseudonym for Bermuda Triangle. It is believed that all the lives lost (and that is in thousands mind you) have been an offering to Satan. It is connoted many times that all those people have been sucked in by Satan to his demonic alley of hell. Dragged deep into the fiery pits of hell, this certainly doesn’t leave many chances of any survivors.
<font color="Red"></H2><H1><b>Theory #2 – Alien Base</b></H1><BR></font>
<H2><BR>Some sci-fi experts say that Bermuda Triangle is actually an extraterrestrial base. People have shared accounts of strange lights suddenly appearing in the sky, blinking like some secret signal and then disappearing, as suddenly. Sometimes, strange noises accompanied the said alien lights that were quite like unintelligible words and spooky chants. The noises were actually chilling sounds that could unhinge even the best of minds.
<font color="Red"></H2><H1><b>Theory #3 – Magnetic Field</b></H1><BR></font>
<H2><BR>Compass and other electronic devices are said to go haywire here. Many planes and sea-ships have disappeared in thin air due to the said phenomenon. No such technology has been developed yet which can defy this weird occurrence, once exposed to its peculiar magnetic field. Just so you know, you can determine the periphery of Bermuda Triangle right when your compass starts going berserk suddenly.
<font color="Red"></H2><H1><b>Theory #4 – The lost city of Atlantis</b></H1><BR></font>
<H2><BR>Bermuda Triangle is said to be the location under which the city of Atlantis is submerged in the ocean. It is said for that the power and charge of Atlantis is what is responsible for all the disappearances. It is often accounted that the battered souls and demons of Atlantis attack the ships and airplanes to avenge their ruins. This theory of Bermuda Triangle seems far-fetched. But, you may never know what all weird stuff has happened in Bermuda Triangle.
<font color="Red"></H2><H1><b>Theory #5 – Own Biosphere</b></H1><BR></font>
<H2><BR>Bermuda Triangle is said to be so eerie that it has its own weather and environment. There have been reports of deadly tornadoes and violent storms when there were no such weather predictions for the area. Many lives and precious articles have been lost in such unheeded calamities of nature. Such strange anomalies have no explanation other than being driven by an atmosphere, unbeknown to us mere mortals.
<font color="Red"></H2><H1><b>Theory #6 – Marches of Methane Hydrates</b></H1><BR></font>
<H2><BR>One of the plausible, yet equally impossible theory is that the Bermuda Triangle sits on the marshes of methane hydrates. If true then scientifically it explains that methane can reduce water density, leading to sinking of ships. But what it doesn’t account for is the disappearances of aircrafts. Also, the riddle of ships with all the supplies but no crew member remains unsolved.
<font color="Red"></H2><H1><b>Theory #7 – Time Travel Tunnel</b></H1><BR></font>
<H2><BR>Number 4 on our list of Bermuda Triangle theories is the time traveling one. People claim to have experienced electronic fog in the triangle which causes travelers to experience time lapse, sometimes resulting in loss of track during the tunneling. Most publicized of such accounts is by one Mr Bruce Gernon. He claimed that he lost 28 minutes while flying over Bermuda Triangle, and re-emerged on Miami Beach, 100 miles farther than his source. He said that all this traveling took hardly a few seconds. Also, he didn’t notice the landscapes and atmosphere change. Even the people at base station back the occurrence that the plane went off the radar, only to re-emerge in Miami within seconds.
<font color="Red"></H2><H1><b>Theory #8 – Secret Organization</b></H1><BR></font>
<H2><BR>Some activists even believe that in the depths of Bermuda Triangle, therein lies a secret organization. The member of said organization abduct and dispose of anyone who comes close to their base or to their secret, both figuratively and literally. Also, the organization is said to have installed interceptors which makes the electronic devices, including the compass navigation, go haywire. No one knows how much truth lies behind such claim, but the pattern is somewhat similar to that of Bermuda Triangle mysteries.
